"The Neighbor" by Rainer Maria Rilke

Strange violin, do you follow me?
In how many distant cities before this
did your lonely night speak to mine?
Do hundreds play you? Or is it only one?

Are there people in all the big cities
who without you would have long since
thrown themselves in the rivers?
And why does it always find me?

Why am I always the neighbor of those
who force you to sing out of fear
and say out loud: Life is heavier
than the weight of all things
